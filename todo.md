#To-Do List
## Simulation
   - [ ] Power allocation (at least for the non-overlapping case).
   - [ ] Random channel (e.g., 10 paths, with random coefficients, delays and scales)
   - [ ] Computation of *basic scaling* a_{star} and *basic delay* T_{star}.
   - [ ] Explain optimal-EB gap.
    * Fisher information?
